# Questions and Answer

- Where do you host your docker?
<p>I'm host my docker on <a href="http://docker.com">docker.io</a> and <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry">Github Container Registry</a></p>

- What is EOL, active, and LTS?
<p><strong>EOL (End of Life)</strong><br>EOL is the end of support for a software, application, and the like. This EOL includes the end of security support, compatibility, and more. Maybe some scripts that use the Nodejs version above which has EOL status will have problems running them.</p>

<p><strong>Active</strong><br>Active is the status where the latest version of Nodejs is released. Usually, this status lasts up to 6 months.</p>

<p><strong>LTS (Long Term Support)</strong><br>LTS is the status where Nodejs is given long-term support. This support includes security, compatibility, and others. Usually, it is the even versions of Nodejs that are given long-term support. The interesting fact is that each version with LTS status has its own code name. For example, Nodejs version 20 is codenamed "Iron".</p>

- Can eggs be installed on my panel?
